--When results call updateGame to see what the result would be, it alters the array, so the game updates
	the board after every tested move. I don't remember how to make a copy so that it doesn't alter th
	original?...



--For some reason, getMove always returns 0

--Need to have choose between 'run' and 'step'

--Need to implement the AND/OR stuff

--Add comments to code

--(When code finished) Gather data from games for report
